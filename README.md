# optical-camera-for-space-navigation
simulator of optical camera sensor for space relative navigation in Matlab/Simulink.

This simulator aims to evaluate the operative range of an optical camera sensor for space relative navigation. You have to provide true relative range of your follower spacecraft relative to the leader spacecraft. The simulator tells you if your real optical camera would be able to compute position for each point in your relative range data. It is very easy to provide relative range data for this simulator purposes, you can do it manually. You don’t need to import complex trajectories by mission analysis tools.


What you have to do:

•	Run initialization camera.m,

•	Enjoy results,

•	Modify the following parameters:

          •	Specifications of optical camera,
          
          •	Image processing capabilities,
          
          •	Pattern specifications,
          
          •	Relative range.
          
•	Repeat.


Details on the structure of the code can be found in details.pdf.
